Bring to room temp!This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up a thick overcooked band in order for the very center to be cooked to your liking.
Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper-this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steak.
Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in again,for the crust.
WARNING:The butter will sputter when you add the thyme,so stand back!
Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your disired internal temprature because the internal temprature will continue to rise as it rests.
REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax.This a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast.
